# Coureur De Bois
Just a simple game where the player can walk around, cut down trees and hunt animals. I made this project during my last semester of college, in Cégep du Vieux-Montréal. I was alone for this project which, in its latest iteration, consists of about 6300 lines of code. 

I did a mistake when starting the project: I chose to use JavaFX to handle the UI and 3D stuff (I didn't know how or where to start programming in 3D, so I used what I found). Looking back, I would use anything else, but it's what I had started my project with, so I was stuck with it until the end of the semester.

## Downloading the project and running it
The IntelliJ IDEA project is located in folder `/src-game-3`. Under the project structure, the language level needs to be set to "8". JavaFX needs to be in your JDK, so either use OpenJDK with OpenJFX, or a version of Oracle JDK that includes JavaFX.
### Planned features and improvements
- walk-in feature for homes
- fixing the lag
### Tech used
